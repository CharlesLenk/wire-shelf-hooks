# Handy Wire Shelf Hook

The Handy Wire Shelf Hook is designed to clip onto a wire shelf.

## Dimensions

By default, the hook has a 20mm interior radius, and the width of the hook is 5mm. This is sufficient to hold most light-weight items you may put in a closet, such as umbrellas, lint rollers, and reusable shopping bags.

## Printing

PETG is recommended for printing the hook. Don't use PLA because it loosens over time with tension, and will eventually fail if you hang anything from it.
